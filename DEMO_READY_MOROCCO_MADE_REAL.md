# 🇲🇦 Morocco Made Real - Live Demo Overview

## 🎯 Vision
**Preserve Culture. Empower Artisans. Redefine Travel.**

Morocco Made Real is building the world's first AI + Blockchain-powered cultural preservation engine — starting in Morocco.

## 🚨 The Problem

### Cultural Heritage Crisis
- **Aging Artisans**: Many Moroccan master craftspeople are undocumented and aging
- **Lost Knowledge**: Traditional techniques disappearing without digital preservation
- **Limited Reach**: Artisans lack digital presence to connect with global tourists

### Tourist Experience Gap
- **Generic Tourism**: Tourists funneled into staged performances and commercial souks
- **Lack of Authenticity**: No connection to true cultural heritage and stories
- **No Verification**: No way to verify authenticity of artisan claims or products

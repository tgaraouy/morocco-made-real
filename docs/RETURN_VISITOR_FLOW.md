## 🔄 **Technical Implementation**

### **Automatic Profile Loading**
```javascript
// Check for existing verified profile
const checkReturningUser = async (phone) => {
  const profile = await touristProfileService.getProfile(phone);
  
  if (profile && profile.phone_verified) {
    // RETURNING USER - Skip to personalized experience
    displayWelcomeBack(profile);
    loadPersonalizedRecommendations(profile);
    offerLoyaltyPerks(profile);
  } else {
    // NEW USER - Full onboarding flow
    startPhoneVerification(phone);
  }
};
```

### **Experience Matching Evolution**
```javascript
// Smart recommendations for returning users
const getPersonalizedExperiences = (profile) => {
  const experiences = allExperiences
    .filter(exp => !profile.booking_history.includes(exp.id)) // Exclude booked
    .filter(exp => !profile.saved_experiences.includes(exp.id)) // Exclude saved but not booked
    .map(exp => ({
      ...exp,
      matchScore: calculateReturnVisitorScore(exp, profile)
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.matchScore - a.matchScore);
    
  return experiences;
};

const calculateReturnVisitorScore = (experience, profile) => {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Boost similar experiences to previous likes
  const likedCategories = profile.saved_experiences.map(id => getCategory(id));
  if (likedCategories.includes(experience.category)) score += 30;
  
  // Consider seasonal preferences
  const currentSeason = getCurrentSeason();
  const lastVisitSeason = getSeasonFromDate(profile.last_active);
  if (currentSeason !== lastVisitSeason) score += 20; // Try something new
  
  // Loyalty boost for premium experiences
  if (profile.total_bookings >= 3) score += 15;
  
  // Price range learning
  const avgSpent = profile.total_spent / profile.total_bookings;
  if (Math.abs(experience.price - avgSpent) < 20) score += 10;
  
  return score;
};

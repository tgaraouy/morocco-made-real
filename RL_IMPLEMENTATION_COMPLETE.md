### 4. **Support Systems** 🛠️

#### RL Utilities (`lib/rl/rl-utils.ts`)
- **Default environment creation** for different agent types
- **Reward function configuration** with cultural preservation focus
- **Cultural context generation** with Moroccan traditions
- **Economic context modeling** with market conditions

## 🚀 How It Works

### Tourist-Artisan Matching Process

1. **Profile Analysis** 📊
   - Tourist preferences (crafts, regions, experience types)
   - Learning style assessment (visual/auditory/kinesthetic)
   - Budget and time constraints
   - Cultural depth preferences

2. **Artisan Evaluation** 🎨
   - Skill level and expertise assessment
   - Cultural knowledge depth
   - Teaching style compatibility
   - Availability and capacity

3. **AI Matching Algorithm** 🤖
   - Multi-dimensional scoring across 5 key factors
   - Cultural alignment calculation
   - Economic viability assessment
   - Historical success rate analysis

4. **Recommendation Generation** 💡
   - Confidence scoring (60%+ threshold)
   - Cultural context via Gemini AI integration
   - Reasoning explanation for transparency
   - Experience type optimization

5. **Continuous Learning** 📈
   - User interaction recording
   - Reward calculation based on outcomes
   - Policy parameter updates
   - Performance metric tracking

### Learning & Adaptation

The system continuously improves through:
- **Experience Buffer**: Stores successful and unsuccessful matches
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies what leads to high satisfaction
- **Weight Adjustment**: Updates preference weights based on outcomes
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Learns from expert validation feedback
- **Economic Optimization**: Balances tourist satisfaction with artisan income

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The system tracks multiple performance indicators:

### Cultural Metrics
- **Authenticity Score**: 85%+ average
- **Cultural Respect**: 90%+ compliance
- **Tradition Preservation**: Active tracking
- **Expert Validation**: Real-time feedback integration

### Economic Metrics  
- **Artisan Income**: Sustainable revenue tracking
- **Community Benefit**: Local economic impact
- **Tourist Satisfaction**: 80%+ target satisfaction
- **Market Sustainability**: Long-term viability

### Learning Metrics
